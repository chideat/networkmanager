i make a miss take that with C++, i didn't take the right object as the correct object.
at first, i thought from global the i designed the networkmanager, but it's wrong, 
many objects of the system couldn't be accessed by me. and my classes were 
directly from networkmanager's UI. it's teriably wrong.

now i've changed my desgin, every connection is en object[original so], every device
[no matter what device it is, ethernet card, wireless card .etc.]. 
and the most important is network class. it take over all the classes.
